# Conversational AI for PDF Interaction

## Overview
This project presents an innovative AI-powered tool that enables users to interact with PDF documents conversationally. By uploading a PDF, users can engage in a Q&A session with the document, receiving answers generated by the advanced "Instructor-xl" language model from Hugging Face.

## Features
- **Conversational Interaction**: Users can ask questions directly to the PDF as if having a conversation.
- **Advanced Language Model**: Utilizes "Instructor-xl" from Hugging Face to understand and generate responses.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit, offering a user-friendly and intuitive experience.

## How It Works
1. **Upload a PDF**: Users start by uploading the document they wish to interact with.
2. **Ask Questions**: Pose questions to the AI about the content of the PDF.
3. **Receive Answers**: The system processes the text, creates embeddings, and provides accurate responses.
